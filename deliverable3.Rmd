## Get up to speed

  As we did in our second entry we must gather what we have done in the previous two entrys. We will again run our script here to make that happen.
  
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

purl("deliverable2.Rmd", output = "part2.r")
source("part2.r")
```
